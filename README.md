# VanillaJuceNet

**VanillaJuceNet** illustrates how to wrap a juce::Synthesiser-derived synth into a simple JUCE-based DSP service, as described in [my ADC 2018 talk](https://juce.com/adc/programme/talks/networking).

This works together with my [VanillaJuce](https://github.com/getdunne/VanillaJuce) synth sample code. **Important:** when checking out the VanillaJuce project:
1. Make sure to check out the "network" branch, not the "master" branch.
2. Ensure that the *VanillaJuce* directory is a sibling of the *VanillaJuceNet* directory.

Refer to http://getdunne.net/wiki/doku.php?id=vanillajucenet for more details.
